## Udacity Nanodegree Self-driving Car Engineer - Project "Behavioral Cloning"

The goal of this project is to train a neural network on images of a car driving around a track and the corresponding steering angles, such that it can then drive autonomously around the track (end-to-end learning).

The project is based on the paper by [Bojarski et al.](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf).
